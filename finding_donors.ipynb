    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **  \n",
    "#### Model 1: Naive Bayes<br>\n",
    "1.1 real-world application\n",
    "\n",
    "> One popular use case of Naive Bayes classifier is for email spam detection in real time. It is based on the Bayes therom:  \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "P(y|X)=\\frac{P(X|y)P(y)}{P(X)}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}  \n",
    "\n",
    "> where $y$ is the class variable, i.e, spam or non-spam, and $X$ is a feature vector containing all the words, i.e, $X=(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ . The Bayes therom can be further expressed as\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "P(y|x_1,...,x_n)=\\frac{P(x_1|y)P(x_2|y)...P(x_n|y)P(y)}{P(x_1)P(x_2)...P(x_n)}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "> Classification is conducted based on the two probabilities, $P(y=spam|X_{test})$ and $P(y=nonspam|X_{test})$.   \n",
    "- If $P(y=spam|X_{test}) > P(y=nonspam|X_{test})$, then the email will be classified as spam.  \n",
    "- Otherwise, it will be classified as non-spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 strengths of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "> - It is easy and fast even with large data sets and numerous variables. It is suitable for doing real-time classification.\n",
    "> - When assumption of independence holds, it performs better compare to other models, like logistic regression, and you need less training data.\n",
    "> - it works well with high-dimensional data such as text classification and email spam detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.3 weakness of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "> It relies on the assumption of independent predictors. In reality, this is not usually the case so it makes Naive Bayes algorithm less accurate than more complicated algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.4 what makes this model a good candidate for the current problem\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Given more than 36000 records and 103 features in the training data set, Naive Bayes is a good candidate since it is fast at handling large data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model 2: Random Forest<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 real-world application\n",
    "> Random forest algorithm can be used in e-commerce for predicting whether the customer will like the recommended products, based on the experience of similar customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 strength of the algorithm\n",
    "> It is powerful at handling large data sets with high dimensionality. It maintains accuracy even when a large proportion of the data are missing. \n",
    "> It can be used for identifying the most important features. \n",
    "> It has low bias, since tree-based models don't rely on any assumptions about the data. \n",
    "> By averaging the predictions of hundreds of decision trees in an ensemble model, random forest overcomes the high variance of a single decision tree.\n",
    "> It avoids overfitting issue via random sampling training data points when building trees and randomly choosing subsets of features when splitting nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3 weakness of the algorithm\n",
    "> The main disadvantage of Random Forest is its complexity. It is time-consuming to construct a large ensemble of trees. \n",
    "> It is also hard to intepret the model, since classification is based on an ensemble of trees and there is no direct link between features and outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.4 what makes this model a good candidate for the current problem\n",
    "> Random Forest has a good balance between bias and variance, and therefore it generally has good prediction performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model 3: AdaBoost<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1 real-world application\n",
    "> AdaBoost is widely used for classification problems, such as predicting customer churn\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 strength of the algorithm\n",
    "> It is simple, versitile, and easy to program. The only parameter to tune is the number of weak learners. \n",
    "> No prior knowledge is needed about weak learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3 weakness of the algorithm\n",
    "> If weak classifiers are too complex, it can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "> If weak classifiers are too weak, it can lead to low margins and overfitting.\n",
    "> It is particularly vulnerable to uniform noise.\n",

    "> Random Forest is a model made up of many decision trees. We actually use decision trees a lot in our daily life without thinking much about it. For example, it is lunch time now and we want to decide where to go for lunch. Our typically way of thinking would be like the followings: firstly, how much time we have for lunch? (< 1 hour or > 1 hour); secondly, what is our budget for lunch? (e.g, < 50 dollars or > 50 dollars); thirdly, what kind of environment we prefer? (modern, romantic, kid friendly, etc); finally, what type of food we want? (American, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, etc). If we want something quick and cheap, fast food or take-outs would be our best choice. If we are meeting with an importance client over lunch, and we want a nice restaurant with good service, some high-end restaurant would be a better choice. Decision trees are such hierarchical structures that help us to make decisions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> To make better decisions, often times we want to hear recommendations from a bunch of people instead of a single person. That is exactly how random forest works. Imagine you ask a few friends for recommendations of restaurants. Each person would probably give you a different suggestion, which is highly dependent on their own situation and preference. Someone may be a fan of authentic Italian food and therefore it is highly likely that this person will recommend a fancy Italian restaurant to you. Another friend may have small kids so the restaurants she/he picks are usually kid friendly. After we get all the votes from our friends, we will make our own decision by choosing the restaurant with the highest votes. Usually the restaurant selected by this process will not disappoint you, since it has been evaluated on various aspects. This is the same concept used by random forest. By taking votes from many decision trees instead of one tree, we have a higher chance to make good decisions. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
